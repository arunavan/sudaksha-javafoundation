Difference between throws and throw.

1.Coding assignment - 05/01/2022
  Write a program to calculate area of a rectangle and area of a square by 
  using method overloading. Take the input for dimension of rectangle and 
  square from console. Handle appropriate exception in order to stop abnormal
  termination of execution
  

2.Coding assignment - 05/01/2022
  Create an array of employeenames in a String array.
  if name is not in the employees list. Create a user defined exception to handle 
  this case. Use appropriate data structure to store employee information

3.Coding assignment - 05/01/2022
  Write a program in Java to display the names and roll numbers of students. 
  Initialize respective array variables for 10 students. Handle 
  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, so that any such problem doesn't cause illegal 
  terminations of program.

4.Create a class called AverageCalculator that has the following method:
  public double calAverage(int n)
  This method receives an integer as a parameter and calculates the average 
  of first n natural numbers. If n is not a natural number, throw an exception 
  IllegalArgumentException with an appropriate message.

5.Create a class  BankAccount having the members as given below:
 accno	int
 custname	String
 acctype	String (indicates ‘Savings’ or ‘Current’)
 balance	float

Include the following methods in the BankAccount class:
void	deposit(float amt);
void	withdraw(float amt);
float	getBalance();

deposit(float amt) method allows you to credit an amount into the current balance. 
If amount is negative, throw an exception InvalidAmountException to block the 
operation from being performed.

withdraw(float amt) method allows you to debit an amount from the current balance. 
Please ensure a minimum balance of Rs.1000/- in the account for savings account 
and Rs.5000/- for current account, else throw an exception InsufficientFunds and 
block the withdrawal operation.
Also throw an exception InvalidAmountException to block the operation from being 
performed if the amt parameter passed to this function is negative.

Add constructor in BankAccount to which you will pass, accno, custname, acctype 
and initial balance and check whether the balance is less than 1000 in case of 
savings account and less than 5000 in case of a current account. If so, then raise 
a LowBalanceException. 
In either case if the balance is negative then raise the InvalidAmountException 
exception accordingly.
